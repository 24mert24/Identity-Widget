This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and uses [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/) for authentication.

This shows an example of how to use the `netlify-identity-widget` with React.

For more info on the `netlify-identity-widget`, [find the repo here.](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget/)
